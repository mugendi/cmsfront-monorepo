# An example hook script to verify what is about to be committed.
# Called by "git commit" with no arguments.  The hook should
# exit with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate message if
# it wants to stop the commit.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "pre-commit".

# Build client production
npm run client:build:prod
# add git build
git add client/build/

# echo "*****Running unit tests******"

# stash_commit="$(git stash create)"
# git reset â€”-hard

# npm test -- --watchAll=false

# status=$?

# if [[ -n "${stash_commit}" ]]
#  then git stash apply "${stash_commit}"

# exit $status
