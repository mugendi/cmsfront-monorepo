# Running & Building

Running the `dev` or `prod` scripts from the `root workspace` will automatically generate all the builds needed before running.

Run `pnpm run dev` for **development** and `pnpm run prod` for **production** mode.

Note: `pnpm run dev` also initializes a server and opens the examples url `http://localhost:10001/examples/index.html`
